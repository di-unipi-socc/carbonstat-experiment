The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015 during the Conference of the Parties (COP21), represents one of the milestones in the global fight against climate change. With nearly 200 signatory nations, this agreement aims to limit the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, striving to keep the increase within 1.5°C. However, the implementation of the Paris Agreement has proven to be a complex challenge, with successes and setbacks characterizing the path of countries in achieving their climate goals.
The primary goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global warming. This global commitment requires a significant reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over the coming decades. Participating nations have committed to establishing and achieving the so-called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which represent each country’s pledges to reduce their emissions.
One of the fundamental characteristics of the Paris Agreement is its flexibility. The NDCs are self-determined, meaning that each country independently decides how much to reduce its emissions based on its national circumstances. This approach recognizes the different responsibilities and capabilities of countries in addressing climate change, particularly distinguishing between developed and developing countries.
Since the Paris Agreement came into force in 2016, there have been some notable progress in the fight against climate change. Many countries have started adopting more ambitious policies and strategies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union, for example, has approved the European Green Deal, which aims to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Similarly, countries like the United Kingdom and France have introduced national laws binding them to emissions reduction and carbon neutrality.
Another success of the Paris Agreement is the increased public and political awareness of the need to act against climate change. The agreement has stimulated global debate on how to mitigate the impact of human activities on the environment, also encouraging the private sector to engage in the energy transition. Many large companies, including tech giants and automobile manufacturers, have announced plans to reduce their emissions and invest in renewable energy.
Despite the progress, the Paris Agreement has faced and continues to face multiple challenges. One of the main challenges is that the current commitments of countries are insufficient to achieve the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. According to a report by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), even if all the currently submitted NDCs were fully implemented, the world would still be on a trajectory towards a temperature increase of around 2.7°C by the end of the century.
A second challenge concerns the financing of the energy transition in developing countries. These countries, while contributing less to global emissions, are often the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. During COP21, developed countries pledged to provide $100 billion annually by 2020 to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change. However, this target has not been fully met, and many developing countries are struggling to secure the funds needed to implement their climate policies.
Furthermore, the lack of a binding enforcement mechanism is another major issue with the Paris Agreement. Although the agreement establishes a framework for reporting and monitoring countries’ progress, it does not provide sanctions for those who fail to meet their commitments. This makes it difficult to ensure that all participating nations adhere to their NDCs.
The future prospects of the Paris Agreement will largely depend on the ability of countries to strengthen their commitments in the coming years. A crucial aspect will be the updating of the NDCs, scheduled every five years. In 2020, many countries submitted updated NDCs with more ambitious targets, but implementing these goals remains a challenge.
Another important area of development concerns climate finance. If developed countries fail to mobilize sufficient resources to help developing countries, the equity and effectiveness of the agreement could be compromised. The Green Climate Fund, established to provide financial assistance to developing countries, has so far been underfunded, and there is growing pressure for richer countries to increase their contributions.
Emerging technologies will also play a fundamental role in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. The large-scale adoption of renewable energy, the promotion of energy efficiency, and the development of new solutions for carbon capture and storage will be essential to reduce global emissions. At the same time, international cooperation and the sharing of technologies between developed and developing countries will be crucial to ensure a fair and equitable energy transition.
Cities are emerging as key actors in the fight against climate change. Many global metropolises, such as New York, Paris, Tokyo, and Sydney, are adopting ambitious climate plans to reduce local emissions and improve urban resilience to the impacts of climate change. These initiatives include improving the energy efficiency of buildings, expanding public transportation networks, and adopting sustainable mobility policies.
Furthermore, cities are collaborating internationally through networks such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, which brings together the world's leading cities committed to fighting climate change. These networks promote the exchange of knowledge and best practices among cities, accelerating the adoption of effective and innovative policies.
The Paris Agreement represents a crucial turning point in the global fight against climate change, but its ultimate success will depend on the continuous commitment of countries and the strengthening of their efforts in the coming years. Although significant progress has been made, the challenges remain enormous. The need to increase commitments, improve climate financing, and develop new technologies will be crucial to ensuring that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C is achieved. In the context of an increasingly interconnected world, international cooperation and collective action will be essential to successfully tackle this global challenge.
